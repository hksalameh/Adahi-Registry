// This file is intended for Next.js Server Actions.
// For the purpose of this scaffold, data management logic (add, update, delete submissions)
// is handled within the client-side AuthContext for simplicity and to avoid
// needing a database setup.

// If you were to use actual Server Actions, you would define functions here
// marked with 'use server'; and they would interact with a database.

// Example of how a server action might look:
/*
'use server';

import type { AdahiSubmission } from './types';
// import { db } from './db'; // Your database client

export async function saveAdahiSubmission(formData: Omit<AdahiSubmission, 'id' | 'submissionDate' | 'status' | 'userId' | 'userEmail'>, userId: string, userEmail: string) {
  try {
    const newSubmission = {
      ...formData,
      userId,
      userEmail,
      submissionDate: new Date().toISOString(),
      status: 'pending' as const,
    };
    // const savedItem = await db.submissions.create({ data: newSubmission });
    // return { success: true, data: savedItem };
    console.log("Server Action: saveAdahiSubmission called with", newSubmission);
    return { success: true, message: "Submission received (mocked)." };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in saveAdahiSubmission:", error);
    return { success: false, error: "Failed to save submission." };
  }
}

// No actual server actions are implemented here for this scaffold,
// as data is managed in AuthContext.tsx.
