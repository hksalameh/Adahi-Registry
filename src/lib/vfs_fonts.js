// This file is intended to hold custom VFS font definitions for pdfMake.
// It should be generated using pdfMake's font building tools if you need custom fonts.
// For example, it would typically start with: this.pdfMake = this.pdfMake || {}; this.pdfMake.vfs = { ...font data... };
// Leaving it empty or with a valid minimal structure if not using custom fonts through this file.
// Ensure this file contains valid JavaScript.
